.Nm bcc
.Nd binary to C/C++ arrays converter
.\" SYNOPSIS
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bcc
.Op Fl 0cs
.Op Fl I Ar num
.Op Fl i Ar num
.Ar filename
.Ar variable
.\" DESCRIPTION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility converts the
.Ar input
file into a C or C++ array named
.Ar variable
that can be embedded as-is in the source code. A special
.Ar -
value can be passed as input which will read standard input instead.
.Pp
The
.Ar variable
can contain any character but only ones that are allowed in the C standard will
be kept, other will be replaced with a
.Dq _ .
Also, the extension (by finding the first .) is removed as well. This can be
handy when generating a lots of file based on their names during a build
process.
.Pp
Note: you must still not start a variable name with digits.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width num-xxx
.It Fl 0
Terminate the generated array with a trailing NUL.
.It Fl c
Generates a
.Em const
array.
.It Fl s
Generates a
.Em static
array.
.It Fl I Ar num
Use
.Ar num
count as leading tab indents.
.It Fl i Ar num
Use
.Ar num
count as leading space indents.

.\" EXAMPLES
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a static, const array from an image.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bcc -sc image.png image > image.h

.Pp
Create a modifiable array from a text file as a NUL terminated string.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bcc -0 text.txt text > text.h

.\" HISTORY
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
tool is inspired by
.Nm xxd
utility but offers more flexibility over the the generated code.
